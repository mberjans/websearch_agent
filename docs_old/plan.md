# **A Phased Development Plan for a Modular Web Search Agent System**

### **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased development plan for a high-performance, modular, and extensible web search agent system. The primary objective is to create a sophisticated platform capable of aggregating search results from a diverse set of sources, including direct web scraping via browser automation and programmatic queries to commercial search APIs. The architecture is founded on four core principles: **Modularity**, ensuring each search method is an independent and interchangeable component; **Dual-Mode Operation**, allowing each module to function as both a standalone command-line tool and an importable library function; **Standardized I/O**, enforcing a consistent JSON data format for seamless interoperability; and **Headless Operation**, guaranteeing compatibility with server-side, non-GUI environments.

## **Section 1: Foundational Architecture and Project Scaffolding**

### **1.1. Scalable Project Structure: The Blueprint for Modularity**

The project will be organized using a "src layout," where the main application code resides within a dedicated package directory (search_agent/). The proposed directory layout is as follows:

```
web_search_agent/  
├── .git/  
├── .venv/ or .poetry/  
├── search_agent/  
│   ├── __init__.py  
│   ├── modules/  
│   │   ├── __init__.py  
│   │   ├── selenium_search.py  
│   │   └── ... (other modules will be added here)  
│   ├── utils/  
│   │   ├── __init__.py  
│   │   └── parsers.py  
│   ├── core/  
│   │   ├── __init__.py  
│   │   ├── models.py         # Pydantic models for I/O schema  
│   │   └── exceptions.py     # Custom exception classes  
│   ├── evaluator.py  
│   ├── orchestrator.py  
│   └── config.py  
├── tests/  
│   ├── __init__.py  
│   ├── test_selenium_search.py  
│   └── ... (tests mirroring the search_agent structure)  
├── docs/  
├── .env  
├── .gitignore  
├── pyproject.toml  
└── README.md
```

### **1.2. Dependency and Environment Management: Choosing Poetry for Reproducibility**

This project will mandate the use of **Poetry** for dependency management due to its superior dependency resolution and ability to create reproducible environments with a poetry.lock file, preventing "dependency hell".

### **1.3. Secure Configuration Strategy: Pydantic and Environment Variables**

The architectural solution is a centralized configuration management system using Pydantic's BaseSettings in conjunction with environment variables, populated from a local .env file during development.

### **1.4. Core System Interfaces: The Contracts for Interoperability**

#### **1.4.1. The Standardized JSON I/O Schema**

Every search module must produce output in a consistent and predictable format using Pydantic models defined in search_agent/core/models.py.

#### **1.4.2. The Dual-Mode (CLI/Library) Module Pattern**

Each search module must be executable as a standalone command-line tool and also be importable as a standard Python function using the **Typer** library.
