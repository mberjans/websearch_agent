### **Phase 1: Foundational Architecture & MVP**

This phase focuses on establishing the project's core structure and delivering the first functional search module.

Ticket ID: WSA-101  
Title: Setup Project Structure, Dependency, and Environment Management  
Description:  
Initialize the project with a standardized, modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.1 This task involves creating the directory layout and configuring the dependency management tool.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The project directory structure is created as specified in Section 1.1 of the development plan.  
2. The project is initialized with Poetry for dependency management. Using Poetry over pip is mandated due to its superior dependency resolution and ability to create reproducible environments with a poetry.lock file, preventing "dependency hell".4  
3. A pyproject.toml file is created, defining project metadata and initial dependencies.  
4. A .gitignore file is created to exclude virtual environments, .env files, and other non-source files from version control.

Ticket ID: WSA-102  
Title: Implement Core Interfaces and Configuration Management  
Description:  
Develop the core data contracts and configuration system that will be used by all modules. This is critical for ensuring interoperability and secure handling of credentials.  
Acceptance Criteria:

1. Pydantic models for SearchResult and SearchModuleOutput are created in search\_agent/core/models.py to enforce a standardized JSON I/O schema.  
2. A centralized configuration module search\_agent/config.py is created using Pydantic's BaseSettings. This approach provides type-safe, validated settings loaded from environment variables, which is a best practice for security and flexibility.10  
3. An .env.template file is created to document required environment variables. The actual .env file must be included in .gitignore.  
4. Custom exception classes (ScrapingError, NoResultsError, etc.) are defined in search\_agent/core/exceptions.py.

Ticket ID: WSA-103  
Title: Implement Selenium Search Module (MVP)  
Description:  
Develop the first search module using Selenium. This module will serve as the proof-of-concept for the dual-mode (CLI/library) architecture and headless browser operation.  
Acceptance Criteria:

1. Create search\_agent/modules/selenium\_search.py.  
2. The module must implement the dual-mode pattern using Typer, providing both an importable search() function and a command-line interface.14  
3. Selenium WebDriver is configured to run Chrome or Firefox in headless mode (--headless=new) for server-side execution.20  
4. The script successfully navigates to DuckDuckGo, submits a query, and scrapes the titles, URLs, and snippets from the first page of results.26  
5. The output is formatted into the standardized JSON structure using the SearchModuleOutput Pydantic model.  
6. The WebDriver instance is properly closed in a finally block to prevent resource leaks.

Ticket ID: WSA-104  
Title: Unit Tests for Selenium Search Module  
Description:  
Create a suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of the Selenium search module.  
Acceptance Criteria:

1. A tests/test\_selenium\_search.py file is created.  
2. Tests are written to verify the core logic of the search() function.  
3. Mocking is used to simulate web requests and HTML responses, so tests can run without actual browser interaction.  
4. Tests verify that the module correctly parses sample HTML and produces the expected JSON output.  
5. Tests confirm that custom exceptions are raised under appropriate failure conditions (e.g., page timeout, no results found).

### **Phase 2: Architectural Validation**

This phase proves the modular architecture by adding a second, technologically distinct search module.

Ticket ID: WSA-201  
Title: Implement Playwright Search Module  
Description:  
Develop a second search module using Playwright to validate the system's modularity. Playwright is chosen for its modern architecture, native asyncio support, and performance advantages over Selenium.32

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Create search\_agent/modules/playwright\_search.py.  
2. The module must adhere to the exact same dual-mode and standardized JSON I/O interfaces as the Selenium module.  
3. The core search() function must be implemented using Playwright's async API.  
4. The module must operate in headless mode.  
5. The module successfully scrapes search results from the target search engine.

Ticket ID: WSA-202  
Title: Unit Tests for Playwright Search Module  
Description:  
Create unit tests for the Playwright search module to ensure its correctness and adherence to the system's interfaces.  
Acceptance Criteria:

1. A tests/test\_playwright\_search.py file is created.  
2. Async-compatible tests are written for the async def search() function.  
3. Tests use mocking to avoid actual browser execution and validate the parsing and JSON output logic against sample HTML.
