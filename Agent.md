Always create and use local Python envrioment via venv. Read the following files docs/checklist.md, docs/plan.md and docs/tickets.md, if they exists. For unchecked tasks on the checklists,  write the program one task of one ticket at a time. Once task is finshed, check it on the  docs/checklist.md, add all changed files to the git using a separate git add command, commit changes with commit message that you generate yourself using individual git commit command, push changes to the git repository with indvidual git push command, and switch to the next task. Once you complete tasks on one ticket, add all changed files to the git using a separate git add command, commit changes with commit message that you generate yourself using individual git commit command, push changes to the git repository with indvidual git push command, switch to the next ticket. After the push, update the momety bank if it exists.  Never chain multiple shell command together with & sign. Never use list comprehension in python. Avoid using regular expression for pattern matching. Instead create special pattern matching function to pattern matching. Work until all bugs are fixed. Please do not ask me for conformation whether I want you to proceedto the next ticket. Just keep working until completing the last ticket.
