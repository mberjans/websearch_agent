PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC8305588 PMID: 34201929 Abstract Metabolomics is a branch of \u2018omics\u2019 sciences that utilises a couple of analytical tools for the identification of small molecules (metabolites) in a given sample. The overarching goal of metabolomics is to assess these metabolites quantitatively and qualitatively for their diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic potentials. Its use in various aspects of life has been documented. We have also published, howbeit in animal models, a few papers where metabolomic approaches were used in the study of metabolic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity. As the goal of every research is to benefit humankind, the purpose of this review is to provide insights into the applicability of metabolomics in medicine vis-\u00e0-vis its role in biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis and management. Here, important biomarkers with proven diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in the management of disease conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease, are noted. The paper also discusses a few reasons why most metabolomics-based laboratory discoveries are not readily translated to the clinic and how these could be addressed going forward. Keywords: metabolomics, metabolites, biomarkers, analytical tools, diseases, diabetes, obesity 1. Introduction Metabolomics is one of the latest on the list of \u2018omics\u2019 sciences after genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics and combines high-throughput analytical techniques with bioinformatics. It deals with quantitative and qualitative assessments of metabolites, which are important intermediates and end products of metabolism [ 1 ]. The goal of this scientific approach is not just to decipher what pathological processes or perturbations underlie a given disease entity but also to predict responses of such conditions to therapeutic interventions. Metabolomic analyses allow us to distinguish between normal and pathological pathways, thereby helping in making disease diagnosis and predicting prognosis [ 2 ]. Given the fact that metabolites are a downstream expression of the various changes that occur in the genome, the proteome, and the transcriptome, they can closely represent the phenotypic fingerprints of an organism at any point in time. The totality of these small-molecule metabolites that are found in a biological sample at a given physiological period and that give an express functional summary of all the metabolic activities going on in a particular biological sample is termed metabolome [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. One notable advantage of metabolome over genome is its ability to reflect the environmental influences [ 5 ] and to give a snapshot of the patho-physiological condition of the individual at a specific point in time [ 6 ]. In animal models, we have utilised a couple of these tools to study some metabolic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]. Our goals in those studies were to gain better insights into the biochemical and pathological processes that are perturbed and to inform the development of more improved therapeutic agents in the management of those disease conditions in humans. Metabolomic tools offer the advantages of being fast, cheap, and sensitive. However, the data generated by these tools mean nothing unless they are properly analysed for the construction of biochemical pathways and for understanding how these pathways interact in both diseased and nondiseased states [ 10 ]. There are several approaches to metabolomics, each of which could be achieved by either mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy techniques (see Figure 2). Examples of such approaches include metabolomic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, metabolic footprinting, target analysis, and flux analysis, each playing significant roles in understanding toxicological mechanisms and disease processes in living organisms [ 1 , 11 , 12 ]. Metabolomics is an equally valuable tool for new drug discovery; biomarker discovery for early disease diagnosis, such as diagnosis of rheumatoid or osteoarthritis [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ], osteoporosis [ 17 ], cardiovascular disease [ 18 ], and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [ 19 , 20 ]; monitoring of cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ]; inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) [ 29 ]; and a host of others. Metabolomics also has applications in such areas as physiology, safety evaluation of new drugs, nutrition, and environmental assessment. The aim of this review is to give an overview of various metabolomic approaches and to highlight some recent biomarker discoveries for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis using these analytical tools. 1.1. Metabolomic Processes/Workflow For a successful targeted or untargeted metabolomic study, the following steps, which have been previously described elsewhere [ 30 ], are followed: experimental design; sample collection, preparation, and metabolite extraction; data acquisition and processing; statistical analysis; and biomarker discovery. Experimental design, the first step in the metabolomic workflow, is informed by the nature of the biological specimen to be used. Hence, questions such as whether human or animal samples or models will be used, whether it will be cell based, tissue based, the whole organism, fluid, or growth medium based, must be answered. Additionally, the metabolomic approach to be employed (targeted or untargeted) and the gap the study attempts to bridge or the problem it seeks to solve are important considerations in designing the experiment. Once this has been settled, the researcher moves to the next phase, namely, sample collection, preparation, and metabolite extraction. For an MS-based approach, this stage is often required and may involve liquid\u2013liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, or filtration technique, depending on the biological samples one is dealing with. For an NMR-spectroscopy-based approach, little or no sample preparation may be required. The third step involves data acquisition and processing. This involves the use of analytical platforms such as MS, NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy. The fourth step is statistical analysis. Here, either or both a univariate analytical tool (e.g., t -test, ANOVA, fold changes) and a multivariate analytical approach (i.e., use of PCA, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA) could be employed. The last step is biomarker discovery. Here, metabolites with differential expressions (overexpression or downregulation) are identified using standardised bioinformatics tools and databases. Figure 1 below gives a summary of the processes involved and the research questions to ask for a successful metabolomic study. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Metabolomic workflow. The first stage involves experimental design, followed by sample collection, preparation, and metabolite extraction. Next is acquisition and processing of data, then data analysis, and finally, making sense of the data through biomarker discovery. 1.2. Analytical Platforms for Data Acquisition and Processing: Strengths and Limitations To have a better understanding of the metabolic milieu of biological systems, analytical platforms are employed to identify and quantify small-molecular-weight metabolites ahead of further analysis of the data generated by the platforms. The two most predominantly utilized analytical tools for metabolomic studies are NMR and MS spectroscopy [ 1 , 31 ]. The MS approach is usually coupled with chromatographic techniques, such as liquid chromatography (LC\u2013MS), especially high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC\u2013MS), and gas chromatography (GC\u2013MS) [ 8 , 32 ] with varying degrees of sensitivity. The MS technique can also be coupled to capillary electrophoresis (CE\u2013MS). Although NMR offers such benefits as easy sample preparation, shorter time for sample analysis, easily identifiable metabolites from analysis of spectra, and better sample recovery, it is only able to analyse less variety of metabolites, and only a few comprehensive metabolite databases for NMR-based metabolomics are currently available [ 6 ]. The ease of sample preparation and the reproducibility of result have made NMR spectroscopy, therefore, a highly sought-after approach for the structural analysis of metabolites [ 33 ]. On the other hand, MS-based techniques can analyse a wide range of metabolites following chromatographic separation, and several comprehensive metabolite databases are presently available [ 17 ]. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of MS-based platforms depends on the chromatographic separation technique with which it is combined [ 33 ]. For instance, while GC\u2013MS gives better chromatographic resolution of the metabolites, LC\u2013MS is the preferred combination when it comes to metabolite coverage and sensitivity [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ]. The MS approach is, however, not without its drawbacks, namely, the sample preparation is more rigorous, the technique could fragment the samples, making recovery almost impossible; and there is much difficulty identifying unknown compounds on its spectra [ 6 ]. Metabolite identification and quantification using the NMR approach (e.g., proton NMR, 13 C NMR, 19 F NMR, 31 P NMR spectroscopy) have been improved in recent years. Of note is the introduction of cyroprobes and microprobes, which have reduced the detection limit by a factor of about 3 to 5 [ 18 ]. This approach is further enhanced by using two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (2D TOCSY) for the confirmation of assigned peaks. The 2D TOCSY spectrum usually shows the correlations between two frequency axes that are derived from two-dimensional Fourier transformations. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), exchange spectroscopy (ES), and J-spectroscopy (JS) are a few other examples of two-dimensional NMR that have been used to improve NMR-based data acquisition and metabolite structure analysis, thereby providing better information than one-dimensional NMR, especially for small-molecule metabolites [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]. Additionally, better outcomes can be achieved by combining two forms of 2D NMR, such as NOESY and HSQC, TOCSY, and HSQC; by combining MS with NMR spectroscopy [ 40 ]; or by using three-dimensional NMR methods. Apart from NMR and MS platforms, another tool that is also being increasingly utilised for metabolomic studies is FTIR spectroscopy [ 32 ]. In general, identification of metabolites is based on their mass, mass/charge ratios, and retention time [ 6 ]. With these parameters in place, both known and unknown compounds could be identified by comparing them with metabolite databases, such as Metlin/XCMS and the Human Metabolome Database [ 6 ]. For compounds with unknown MS and NMR spectra characteristics, an untargeted approach and chemometrics could be applied for metabolite pattern identification [ 6 ]. A brief description of the foremost analytical platforms for metabolomic studies is shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2. Open in a new tab Summary of the major analytical platforms for metabolomic studies in human and animal samples. The figure depicts the three most often employed platforms for metabolomic studies\u2014MS, NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy. The MS-based approach involves coupling with liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE). 1.3. Metabolomic Data Analysis Profiling the metabolites in each biological entity is incomplete without an accurate data measurement and precise interpretation of the information garnered from such exercise. Metabolomic data analysis encompasses feature extraction, compound identification, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Use of multivariate analyses, such as PCA, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA, is key to achieving this. Together, these pattern recognition analytical techniques (PCA, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA) help to comprehensively assess the metabolites that are present in any given biological sample or that are associated with a specific disease condition [ 11 ]. Scores from PCA plots show a scattering of the samples, and when they are clustered together, it shows that the metabolites are alike; otherwise, they are dissimilar [ 11 ]. PLS-DA, on the other hand, is a very versatile algorithm with a better predictive and descriptive advantage over PCA. It seeks to maximise the covariance between the classes much better than PCA. Bioinformatics tools available for metabolomic data analysis, pathway analysis, and interpretation include Metabox (available for free at http://kwanjeeraw.github.io/metabox/ (accessed on 10 January 2020) under the GPL-3 license) [ 30 ] and MetaboAnalyst (available at http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst (accessed on 10 January 2020)) [ 20 ]. Others include SECIMTools, Meta XCMS, XCMS, XCMS2, MetAlign, MZmine for data processing of MS data, and MetDAT for statistical analysis and pathway visualization. 2. Results This mini review focuses on five disease conditions in which metabolomic tools have been utilised for diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis prediction. The first four of these conditions are chronic non-communicable diseases in adults, while the fifth is a group of inborn errors of metabolism in children. These medical disorders are Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), diabetic retinopathy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)/dementia, cardiovascular disease, and inborn error or metabolism (IEM). Out of the 26 publications that were included in this review, 3 were adjudged to be relevant to our research interest with respect to PD [ 41 , 42 , 43 ], 5 with respect to diabetic retinopathy [ 30 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ], 2 for AD [ 16 , 46 ], 14 for cardiovascular disease [ 18 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 ], and 2 for IEM [ 59 , 60 ]. Of the 3 most often utilised platforms for metabolic profiling, MS spectroscopy (coupled with other separation techniques) ranks first, being employed for biomarker discovery in 17 out of the 26 studies identified, and accounting for 65.4% of all studies. This was followed by NMR spectroscopy, which accounted for just 19.2% (5 studies) of cases. In terms of statistical analysis, multivariate analysis involving PCA and/or PLS-DA was utilised in 6 studies [ 41 , 46 , 47 , 49 , 54 , 61 ], followed by the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or area under the curve (AUC) analysis [ 30 , 42 , 50 , 56 , 58 ]. Details of the study characteristics, the analytical tools employed, and the respective biomarkers identified are summarised in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively. Table 1.

Discussion A combination of metabolomic study and multivariate data analysis offers tremendous advantages of understanding specific pathways of metabolism that are perturbed in a particular disease state [ 10 , 16 ]. Information derived from such scientific efforts goes a long way in providing insights into useful diagnostic and therapeutic metabolite biomarkers for effective disease management [ 14 ] and prognostication. Below are a few examples of disease conditions with their recently documented clinically relevant metabolic biomarkers. 3.1. Parkinson\u2019s Disease Currently, PD affects well over 4 million people globally, and sadly, this figure is expected to double over the next few decades [ 65 ]. This progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting mostly the adult population, is difficult to manage. Despite many years of research, a lot is still unknown about the aetiology of the disease [ 66 ]. The reason for this may be that it is a multifactorial disease, and that multiple mechanistic pathways may be involved in its causation [ 21 ]. In addition, only a few disease-modifying therapies are presently available. This is largely secondary to absence of effective biomarkers that could aid in both disease diagnosis and treatment [ 66 ]. Existing diagnosis efforts rely heavily on symptoms, patient history, and clinical examination, making misdiagnosis inevitable in clinical settings [ 66 ]. A better diagnostic approach that is simple, fast, and less invasive is therefore needed, and metabolomic tools have been reported to show great assurance in this regard [ 41 ]. In a recent study, Saiki et al. [ 42 ] carried out a metabolomic analysis using capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography coupled with MS on blood samples (a less invasive procedure compared with the use of CSF) and identified 18 PD-specific metabolites. In this research, significant decreases in the levels of seven long-chain acylcarnitines were identified as promising metabolite biomarkers in PD diagnosis. In another study, Havelund et al. [ 43 ] utilised LC\u2013MS to assess levels of kynurenine metabolites in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples of healthy individuals and compared them with those of three categories of PD patients: PD patients not on medications, PD patients undergoing treatment using L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) who have developed dyskinesia, and PD patients who are yet to develop dyskinesia despite prolonged use of L-DOPA. Their findings showed an approximate fourfold rise in the ratio of 3-hydroxykynurenine to kynurenic acid in plasma samples and a significant decrease in anthranilic acid levels in both plasma and CSF samples of PD patients with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The study further reported a twofold increase in the levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan in all of the L-DOPA-treated PD patients (with or without dyskinesia). The researchers concluded that a higher 3-hydroxykynurenine/kynurenic acid ratio in plasma could serve as a biomarker in the diagnosis of dyskinesia induced by L-DOPA [ 42 ]. In another targeted metabolomic study that compared the levels of some metabolites in PD patients in early Hoehn\u2013Yahr stage \u2264 2 with those in the advanced stage of the disease (Hoehn\u2013Yahr stage > 2), Chang et al. [ 41 ] reported that the former category of patients had lower levels of kynurenine acid (KA) and kynurenine acid/kynurenine ratio and higher levels of quinolinic acid (QA) and QA/KA ratio when compared with patients in the early stage of the disease and normal controls, demonstrating significant metabolite signatures that could serve as biomarkers in the plasma of PD patients. 3.2. Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major complications that result from chronic, long-standing diabetes mellitus among individuals who suffer from this medical condition. Mazumder et al. [ 44 ], in a study involving human subjects, utilised FTIR spectroscopy to analyse serum samples and identified 12 important biomarkers with potentials to significantly discriminate between diabetic patients with retinopathy and those without this complication. Two of these biomarkers were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, 5 with alterations in lipid contents, 4 with protein phosphorylation, and 3 with the amide II group [ 44 ]. An untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomic approach was equally applied for the analysis of the vitreous humour of patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, and healthy subjects in a recent study [ 45 ]. Here, significant alterations in glucose metabolism and activation of the hexose monophosphate shunt were reported. In addition, alteration in purine metabolism (characterised by a decrease in xanthine and elevation in purine-related compounds, such as inosine, hypoxanthine, urate, and allantoate) was seen in those with diabetic retinopathy but absent in those with retinal detachment and healthy controls. The researchers concluded that significant perturbations in vitreous humour metabolism in diabetic retinopathy account for the characteristic oxidative stress seen in patients with this complication and show how the vitreous metabolite profile could be affected by the disease [ 45 ]. Again, noteworthy diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 30 ]. In a large population-based study aimed at profiling the plasma metabolites of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, Zhu and others [ 30 ] reported alterations in the metabolism of 63 metabolites, out of which 4 metabolites, namely, fumaric acid, uridine, acetic acid, and cytidine (with areas under the curve of 0.96, 0.95, 1.0, and 0.95, respectively), were identified as candidate biomarkers for this sight-threatening condition. According to the researchers, this study was the first to report fumarate as a novel biomarker in relation to diabetes or diabetic retinopathy diagnosis [ 20 ]. Using a combination of gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultraperformance liquid chromatography\u2013quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry tools, Rhee et al. [ 46 ] identified plasma glutamine and glutamate as potential biomarkers for predicting the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients with long-standing diabetes. That significant oxidative stress and alteration in the pathway of glutamate metabolism are associated with diabetic retinopathy was equally reported by Jin et al. [ 47 ]. Other metabolites that have shown relevance as important biomarkers for making diagnosis or predicting prognosis in diabetic retinopathy include lactic acid, succinic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, asparagine, dimethylamine, histidine, threonine, and glutamine [ 47 ]. 3.3. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD)/Dementia This is a progressive degenerative disease affecting the brain. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with diabetes mellitus and hypertension globally. AD is a major cause of vascular dementia, a very debilitating condition characterised by a progressive decline in memory and behavioural and social skills, especially in the elderly. Presently, biomarkers for early disease diagnosis are inadequate in that they are mostly invasive, time-consuming, and expensive [ 2 ]. To this end, a blood-based approach for diagnosing AD using metabolic fingerprinting has been proposed [ 67 ]. Metabolomic approaches have shown great promise in bridging this gap, especially with its application on blood samples, a less invasive and cheaper mode of sample collection, in advanced stages (e.g., with dementia) of the disease [ 68 ]. In a recent large population study aimed at assessing the association between plasma total tau levels, cognitive decline, and risk of mild cognitive impairment in dementia, Mielke et al. [ 61 ] reported that higher total tau levels were associated with significant reduction in cognition, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability of the patients, while this association is independent of a rise in the level of brain amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Identification of diagnostic biomarkers in the saliva of individuals with AD has equally been reported using proton-NMR-based metabolomics [ 20 ]. In this pilot study, significant concentration changes in the levels of 22 metabolites were observed in the saliva samples of those with mild cognitive impairment and dementia compared with healthy control. The implication of these findings is that, by simply collecting blood samples or saliva from an individual with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, progression to vascular dementia or other cognitive impairment could be detected early easily and managed promptly. 3.4. Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of stroke and sudden death, especially among adults with hypertension. Notwithstanding the several risk managements, preventive measures, and treatment modalities that have been initiated for CVDs, patients have continued to die from cardiac-related complications, hence the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for managing this condition [ 69 ]. Metabolomics has offered a very promising alternative to surmounting this problem by making possible the identification of important biomarkers for diagnosis and risk assessment for CVD development even before patients begin to show overt symptoms [ 61 ]. In a recent study involving the use of an untargeted metabolomic approach, namely, stable isotope dilution tandem MS (LC\u2013MS/MS), Li et al. [ 18 ] identified trimethyllysine as a predictor of incident cardiovascular risk. Using Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses, the researchers discovered a significant correlation between this biomarker (trimethyllysine) and the artherogenic metabolite trimethylamine N -oxide. In another untargeted metabolomic study aimed at finding the association between chronic air pollution exposure and risk of developing bronchial asthma and cardiovascular disease, Jeong and others [ 48 ] identified three important pathways of metabolism, namely, linoleate, glycosphingolipid, and carnitine shuttle pathways as key mediators of these health effects among those who were exposed. The strength of this study, which utilised the novel \u2018meet in the middle\u2019 statistical approach, lies in the fact that it was prospective in nature (namely, a case\u2013control study nested in longitudinal cohorts) [ 34 ]. Metabolomic tools have also been employed to study the pathology of myocardial infarction (MI). Zhu et al. [ 49 ] examined the plasma of MI patients using UPLS\u2013Q/TOF\u2013MS and identified 10 metabolites that satisfactorily distinguished MI patients from healthy controls. These metabolite biomarkers include C16-sphingosine, N -methyl arachidonic amide, phosphatidylserine, N -(2-methoxyethyl) arachidonic amide, linoleamidoglycerophosphate choline, lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:2), lysophosphatidylcholine (C16:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:1), arachidonic, and linoleic acid, as well as perturbations in energy, fatty acid, and phospholipid metabolism. Aside from its potential in discriminating between persons with myocardial infarction and healthy controls, metabolomics has equally been shown to have the ability to predict the risk of developing acute myocardial infarction with fragmented QRS in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [ 50 ]. In a recent hospital-based cohort study, Li et al. [ 50 ] performed a global metabolic profiling using UPLS\u2013Q/TOF\u2013MS on a cohort of 136 non-coronary artery disease and 118 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing PCI and identified four metabolites as important biomarkers. These metabolites (acetylglycine, threoninyl-glycine, glutarylglycine, and nonanoylcarnitine) were reported to significantly discriminate between AMI with fragmented QRS and that without it. In another study involving 79 patients with heart failure, Chen and others [ 52 ] reported that significant perturbations in fatty acid metabolism are associated with acute decompensation in this patient category. In this case\u2013control hospital-based study, acylcarnitine was identified and quantified as an important metabolite biomarker using MS spectroscopy. Serum concentrations of three other metabolites, namely, citrate, tyrosine, and 2- and 3-hydroxybutyrates, have also been linked to increased mortality rate among patients with acute heart failure [ 55 ]. Other cardiovascular diseases for which a metabolomic approach has been used include ischaemic cardiomyopathy [ 51 ], coronary artery disease [ 53 ], ischaemic stroke [ 54 , 64 ], myocardial infarction [ 56 ], atherosclerosis [ 58 ], and heart failure [ 64 ]. Furthermore, metabolomic tools have been used to study the mechanistic pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of some herbal medicines [ 62 ]. 3.5. Inborn Error of Metabolism Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders that occur commonly among under-5 children. Traditionally, the diagnosis of IEMs relies on history taking, clinical examination, and a few biochemical tests. The risk of having false negatives with the use of this mode of diagnosis is, therefore, remarkably high, and examining only a limited section of the pathway of metabolism hinders the discovery of novel metabolic disorders [ 59 ]. An untargeted metabolomic approach that utilises a single platform rather than targeted metabolite profiling with multiple platforms is now being recommended in that it is cost-effective and helps in identifying a huge amount of small-molecular-weight compounds in a single metabolic pathway [ 60 ]. In their recent study, Bonte et al. [ 60 ] carried out an untargeted metabolic screening for IEMs using a semiautomatic sample preparation with a UHPLC\u2013Orbitrap\u2013MS platform on 53 patients with 33 distinct IEMs and 260 controls. This novel metabolomic approach identified well over 17,256 compound ions and was able to correctly diagnose IEM in about 90% of cases, including the detection of mannosyl-\u03b21,4- N -acetylglucosamine, the latest biomarker for \u03b2-mannosidase deficiency [ 60 ]. In this study, two diagnoses, however, remained undetected, namely, alkaptonuria and mevalonic aciduria. Except for a few cases of IEMs, such as argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, and GAMT deficiency, Coene and others [ 59 ] were also able to accurately diagnose 42 out of 46 cases using a similar metabolic platform (high-resolution liquid chromatography\u2013quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF)), underscoring the vital role of metabolomics in identifying disease-specific biomarkers among suspected cases of IEMs. 4. Methods Medline search (linked to medical subject headings\u2014MeSH) conducted on 24 May 2021 for recent studies involving the use of metabolomic tools for biomarker discovery in disease diagnosis and management yielded 453 records ( Table 3 ). Additional 16 records were retrieved from other databases and hand-searched references. Table 3. Summary of the MeSH search terms conducted for the retrieval of recent studies in metabolomics. # Searches Results 1 exp metabolomics/ or exp lipidomics/ 19,211 2 exp biomarkers, pharmacological/ 1963 3 Diagnosis/ 17,434 4 Prognosis/ 533,501 5 Therapeutics/ 8516 6 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 559,030 7 1 and 6 453 Open in a new tab Overall, 26 papers met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only original articles that have identifiable metabolites as biomarkers and that report the use of analytical tools such as NMR spectroscopy, MS, and FTIR spectroscopy in any of the five selected disease conditions were included in this study. Other inclusion criteria were the use of a noninvasive (such as the use of urine, sweat, breath) or minimally invasive (such as the use of venepuncture) mode of sample collection. As such, review papers, mini reports, studies in animal subjects, or studies that involved the use of invasive techniques, such as lumbar puncture, instrumentation, or surgery, were excluded. To capture only recent developments in this field, we limited our search to the years 2015\u20132020. With these inclusion and exclusion criteria in mind, we initially reviewed abstracts of  before retrieving the full texts of papers that were considered relevant for our inclusion and assessment. We additionally hand-searched references of studies that were initially accessed for other articles that could be of relevance to our research focus. Finally, only 26 papers were included in this review. 5. Research Limitations One of our research goals was to be able to delineate what profiling approach is utilised in each of the studies included in this review. However, only three [ 45 , 48 , 53 ] of the identified articles expressly reported utilising untargeted approaches in their studies; others did not report whether their metabolite profiling study was targeted or untargeted (global). Another limitation was paucity of relevant literature, arising from the extremely strict inclusion/exclusion criteria we employed. This makes it extremely hard to draw far-reaching, evidenced-based conclusions on the usefulness of metabolomic tools in disease diagnosis and management. 6. Conclusions and Future Perspective The field of metabolomics, no doubt, has grown and continues to grow beyond merely profiling the metabolites in biological samples to identification of novel biomarkers of disease diagnosis, treatment, progression, and prognosis. While it has provided enormous insights and better characterisation of biological pathways associated with myriads of pathophysiological disturbances occurring in living organisms, a lot of factors still hinder the translation of such research outputs into clinical and industrial applications [ 70 ]. The overarching purpose of this review is to both create an awareness on the relevance of metabolomic profiling to medical practice and the need to harness resources (human and material) towards ensuring that laboratory findings (especially as regards biomarker discovery) become translational. In 2018, experts in metabolomics met at an Australian and New Zealand Metabolomics Conference (ANZMET 2018) held in Auckland, New Zealand, where they identified several factors mitigating against the applicability of metabolomic approaches in the clinics [ 70 ]. Among others, poor public perception of metabolomics as an important field of \u2018omics\u2019 science, costs of procuring analytical instruments, the multidisciplinary nature of metabolomic studies (requiring inputs of experts from different fields of life sciences), and variability in the modes of data acquisition were noted as constituting major bottlenecks in the development of translational metabolomics [ 70 ]. Equally significant is the fact that metabolomics does not take into consideration the pivotal role that gender plays as an important determinant of some disease conditions. To ensure better personalised treatment, experts have equally suggested that metabolomic studies must take sex into consideration [ 10 ]. The number of metabolites identified as biomarkers for some disease conditions is large, making it difficult to pin down what metabolites are the most important biomarkers or predictors of disease development, progression, or therapeutic response. Future research efforts, therefore, must be geared towards addressing the issue of cost and other challenges that make metabolomics difficult to apply in the clinics. Funding research and developing algorithms that reduce the number of diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic biomarkers to the barest minimum should also be vigorously pursued. Finally, we have noted here that the use of a noninvasive or minimally invasive mode of sample collection for biomarker discovery is possible and holds great promise for acceptability by patients, especially when combined with analytical tools with wide metabolite coverage [ 71 ]. However, there is a need for the validation and optimization of these tools to arrive at more accurate and precise metabolic biomarkers that are useful in this respect.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC11247213 PMID: 39011161 Abstract Metabolomics, a cutting-edge omics technique, is a rapidly advancing field in biomedical research, concentrating on the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms and the discovery of novel metabolite signatures predictive of disease risk, aiding in earlier disease detection, prognosis and prediction of treatment response. The capacity of this omics approach to simultaneously quantify thousands of metabolites, i.e. small molecules less than 1500 Da in samples, positions it as a promising tool for research and clinical applications in personalized medicine. Clinical metabolomics studies have proven valuable in understanding cardiometabolic disorders, potentially uncovering diagnostic biomarkers predictive of disease risk. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is the predominant analytical method used in metabolomics, particularly untargeted. Metabolomics combined with extensive genomic data, proteomics, clinical chemistry data, imaging, health records, and other pertinent health-related data may yield significant advances beneficial for both public health initiatives, clinical applications and precision medicine, particularly in rare disorders and multimorbidity. This special issue has gathered original research articles in topics related to clinical metabolomics as well as research articles, reviews, perspectives and highlights in the broader field of translational and clinical metabolic research. Additional research is necessary to identify which metabolites consistently enhance clinical risk prediction across various populations and are causally linked to disease progression. Keywords: Mass spectrometry, Metabolite, Metabolomics, Multi-omics, Obesity, Omics, Precision medicine 1. Introduction to clinical metabolomics Precision medicine aims to enhance patient prognosis and stratification by leveraging knowledge of biological mechanisms and biomarkers [ 1 ]. Research and practices oriented towards precision medicine have been successfully implemented in various diseases, including metabolic, malignant, respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive tract and inflammatory. The applications of precision medicine can be further categorized into several areas, such as large-scale screening, early detection, molecular phenotyping and prognosis of disease as well as prediction of treatment response [ 1 ]. Metabolomics, a cutting-edge omics technique, has emerged due to the advance in analytical methods and bioinformatics. Typically, the metabolomics approach utilizes sophisticated analytical chemistry tools, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with various chromatographic techniques, i.e. gas chromatography (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography (LC-MS), to determine and characterize the metabolome, focusing on molecules smaller than 1500 Da in cells, organs, tissues, or biofluids [ 2 ]. The recent emergence of medical genomics introduces innovative technological tools for determining genetic predispositions to diseases. However, metabolomics enables us to go further by connecting the pathological phenotype with gene expression defects and disorders. The term \"clinical metabolomics\" first appeared in the literature in 2009, although the concept was initially described in 2008 [ 3 ]. The objective of clinical metabolomics is to assess and predict a subject's health and disease risk by determining metabolic signatures in body fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, etc) or tissues, which are influenced by genetics, epigenetics, dietary patterns, environmental parameters and behavior [ 4 ]. Metabolic signatures comprise a group or a combination of affected metabolites. The metabolome may be studied both intracellularly, revealing functional abnormalities at the cellular level, and peripherally, such as in biofluids, particularly blood plasma, which contains a multitude of metabolites that reflect organ metabolic activity and provide valuable pathophysiological information [ 2 ]. Some metabolites in human plasma are synthesized endogenously, while others originate from the environment. The variability in the metabolome is partly hereditary and is significantly influenced by parameters such as dietary patterns, gut microbiota and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking or physical activity). Diet and the microbiome constitute the main contributors to individual metabolic variability, rendering each person's metabotype unique [ 5 ]. However, in the absence of significant health changes, an individual's metabotype remains relatively stable throughout time. The examination of metabolites is based on two general approaches: 1) targeted metabolomics, which focuses on determining a specific set of metabolites, and 2) untargeted metabolomics, which uses an unbiased approach to determine and compare as many metabolites as possible, comprising unknown ones, between samples. Using the latter approach, a plethora of metabolite features\u2014peaks corresponding to individual ions with distinctive mass-to-charge ( m / z ) ratios and retention times (RT)\u2014may be routinely detected via LC/MS-based methods [ 2 ]. The choice between these approaches depends on the specific desired application. The two primary techniques for metabolomics studies are mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Combining these methods can address many of their individual limitations, thereby enhancing metabolome coverage [ 6 ]. MS-based metabolomics provides a wide metabolite coverage ranging from polar metabolites to non-polar lipids and excels at detecting low-abundance metabolites, whilst NMR is effective at identifying core metabolites in key metabolic pathways [ 7 ]. Moreover, NMR is analytically more powerful, high-throughput and low cost, allowing the study of many participants [ 8 ]. Notwithstanding untargeted metabolomics has influenced the pathogenetic understanding of disease pathways via the identification of novel biomarkers in metabolic pathways, it could detect metabolites that may not be identified because they are not present in the software library [ 9 ]. Metabolomics studies have proven valuable in understanding cardiometabolic disorders, potentially uncovering diagnostic biomarkers predictive of disease risk. This could facilitate earlier disease detection and improve prognosis. Obesity increases the risk of various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cancer, infections and autoimmune disorders [ [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] ]. However, the mechanisms connecting adiposity to adverse health outcomes remain not fully elucidated, whereas the metabolome may play an important role. In obesity research, metabolomics has been utilized to predict body mass index (BMI) and adiposity, enhance the understanding of metabolic dysregulation caused by increased adiposity, and forecast the effectiveness of obesity treatment [ 16 ]. Metabolic disturbances stemming from increased adiposity are systemic and far-reaching, comprising glucose and lipid metabolism and being implicated in low-grade chronic inflammation. Robust associations have consistently been seen with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) [ 16 ]. An untargeted metabolomics study revealed that nearly a third of the metabolome is linked to BMI, specifically lipids, amino acids, and peptides. The majority of these metabolites, including glucose, alanine, tyrosine, kynurenate, \u03b3-glutamyltyrosine and phospholipids, are also linked to higher insulin resistance and may mediate the connection between adiposity and metabolic disorders [ 17 ]. Characterizing metabolic profiles of adiposity (and fat distribution) can enhance its clinical management. Metabolomics studies have identified that plasma steroid sulfates and amino acids are indicative of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity in subjects with obesity who do not have insulin resistance [ 18 ]. Larger clinical metabolomics studies may shed light on the pathways characterizing metabolically unhealthy overweight and obesity, leading to more effective treatments. T2DM is an increasingly prevalent metabolic disorder linked to complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases as well as retinopathy and infections [ [19] , [20] , [21] ]. Among the metabolite classes associated with T2DM, BCAAs are particularly prominent, with significant associations consistently shown in large clinical metabolomics studies [ 22 ]. Clinical metabolomics may illuminate pathways and biomarkers that predict the progression from normoglycemia to T2DM, from prediabetes to T2DM and the development of diabetic complications. In subjects with normal fasting glucose, data from a specific set of 19 metabolites enhanced the prediction of T2DM beyond conventional risk factors. Additionally, the nitrogen metabolism pathway, which comprises 3 prioritized metabolites, i.e. glycine, taurine and phenylalanine, and its components were identified as potential effectors in T2DM onset [ 23 ]. In a meta-analysis, metabolite concentrations of alanine, glutamate, and palmitic acid (C16:0) were significantly different between prediabetic and diabetic patients [ 24 ]. In another meta-analysis of clinical metabolomics studies, 5 metabolites, characterized as essential metabolites, differed significantly in patients with diabetic renal disease (decreased glycine, aconitic acid, glycolic acid and uracil, and increased cysteine) compared to controls [ 25 ]. Further research is required to validate these findings and assess their clinical meaning. Finally, research that integrates genomics with comprehensive metabolic profiling using high-throughput metabolomics platforms has facilitated the discovery of numerous loci associated with metabolic traits related to circulating lipids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, and amino acids. These investigations offer fresh insights into human metabolism biology, and have steered large epidemiological studies, such as Mendelian randomization analyses, to infer causal associations [ 26 ]. In the very recent and largest metabolomics study combined with genome-wide association study involving 136,016 participants, over 400 independent genomic regions influencing 233 circulating metabolic biomarkers, including lipoproteins and lipids, were identified [ 27 ]. Genetic pleiotropy, whereas the same genetic variation influences several metabolic processes, spanning traits related to lipids, lipoproteins, and fatty acids, was an important study finding. This study also underscored the significance of participant characteristics, such as fasting status, which can significantly influence genetic associations [ 27 ]. Metabolomics combined with extensive genomic data, proteomics, clinical chemistry data, imaging, health records, and other pertinent health-related data may yield significant discoveries beneficial for both public health initiatives, clinical applications and precision medicine, particularly in rare disorders and multimorbidity [ 28 ]. This multi-omics approach combined with health and laboratory data is advancing with the integration of machine learning tools and artificial intelligence. The generated extensive data enable the training of robust machine learning models for both classification and regression analyses. In metabolomics, additional research is necessary to determine which metabolites consistently enhance clinical risk prediction across diverse populations and are causally linked to disease progression. Besides the hurdles associated with replication issues, the development of validated assays and the enhancement of study participants diversity may enhance the clinical relevance of findings in metabolomics studies [ 29 ]. These challenges encompass the identification of the chemical composition of unidentified metabolites arising from untargeted metabolomics, the standardization of metabolites across various platforms and experiments, the decrease of expenses related to untargeted metabolomics, and the thorough modeling disease risk in integrative multi-omics investigations. 2. Special issue on clinical metabolomics This special issue has gathered original research articles in topics related to clinical metabolomics as well as research articles, reviews, perspectives and highlights in the broader field of translational and clinical metabolic research. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial condition that requires innovative approaches to uncover its underlying mechanisms. Metabolites, which comprise the final products of genes, transcripts, and proteins regulations, may reveal insights into disease pathogenesis [ 30 ]. While blood is commonly used in metabolomics studies, extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain cell-specific biological material and can cross the blood-brain barrier, merit further exploration as a potential source of biological material [ [30] , [31] , [32] ]. Nielsen et al. aimed at examining metabolites derived from blood and EVs to better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of AD [ 32 ]. Although no significant EV-derived metabolites were identified that could differentiate patients from healthy individuals, six important serum metabolites were discovered: valine, histidine, allopurinol riboside, inosine, 4-pyridoxic acid, and guanosine. Pathway analysis indicated that BCAAs, purine, and histidine metabolism were downregulated, while vitamin B6 metabolism was upregulated in AD patients compared to controls [ 32 ]. Using a combination of LC-MS and NMR methodologies, the study identified several altered mechanisms potentially related to AD pathogenesis. The researchers concluded that further optimization of EVs is necessary before they can be effectively used as a biological material for AD-related metabolomics studies [ 32 ]. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a malignant disease with a poor prognosis, with most patients being already in a metastatic stage at diagnosis. Current diagnostic methods rely on clinical imaging using computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT in combination with cytological/histopathological biopsies of the tumor-suspected lesions of the lung [ 33 , 34 ] Few blood-based biomarkers have been clinically examined for diagnosis and screening [ [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] ]. Although the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of SCLC are not fully understood, several genetic mutations, protein and metabolic abnormalities have been identified. The study by Pedersen et al. aimed at identifying metabolite alterations related to SCLC in order to enhance the understanding of this aggressive cancer [ 40 ]. Among others, metabolites involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle (succinate), lipid metabolism (LDL triglyceride, LDL-1 triglyceride, LDL-2 triglyceride, LDL-6 triglyceride, LDL-4 cholesterol, HDL-3 free cholesterol, HDL-4 cholesterol, HDL-4 apolipoprotein-A1, HDL-4 apolipoprotein-A2), amino acids (glutamic acid, glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine, creatine), and ketone body metabolism (3-hydroxybutyric acid, acetone) were found deranged in the pre-treatment serum samples of SCLC patients compared to healthy individuals. This study offers new insights into the metabolic disturbances in pre-treatment SCLC patients, enhancing the molecular understanding of this malignant disease [ 40 ]. Research has demonstrated that cell metabolism actively influences the regulation of stemness and fate determination. The study by Olesen et al. aimed to characterize the metabolic activity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from various developmental stages in response to different oxygen levels during expansion, with the goal of identifying optimal culture conditions for MSCs before transplantation [ 41 ]. In contrast to adult MSCs, they found that fetal MSCs exhibited similar respiration and aerobic glycolysis across various oxygen culture concentrations during expansion. Adult MSCs adapted their respiration to glycolytic activities based on the culture conditions, indicating a more mature metabolic function. These observations are pertinent for establishing ideal in vitro culture conditions to enhance engraftment and therapeutic efficacy [ 41 ]. The gut mycobiome, although small, is a crucial and functional component of the gut ecosystem. Changes in its composition have been linked to several diseases, including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome [ [42] , [43] , [44] , [45] ]. However, little is known about the composition and long-term stability of the gut mycobiome in middle age and later life, as well as the interactions between gut fungal and bacterial communities in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, the relationship between the gut mycobiome and metabolic health is not well understood. The gut mycobiome has been associated with cardiometabolic disorders in animal models and some human studies [ 44 ]. The perspective by Dalamaga et al. reviewed the findings of a multiomics and longitudinal study conducted by Dr. Zheng and colleagues [ 44 , 46 ]. This study explored the impact of age, diet, and various sociodemographic and clinical factors on the gut mycobiome. The research involved mapping the gut mycobiome of 1244 Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults from the population-based Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study cohort [ 46 ]. The study findings underscore the significance of the intestinal fungal community as a crucial element within the gut ecosystem, contributing significantly to its long-term stability. This integrated cross-kingdom analysis has the potential to expand our understanding and identification of new preventive and therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders [ 46 ]. Sepsis, characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from infection, represents a significant global cause of mortality and morbidity [ [47] , [48] , [49] , [50] ]. Given its systemic nature, multiple organ systems may become affected [ [51] , [52] , [53] ]. During sepsis, impaired liver function correlates with elevated bilirubin levels and reduced levels of fetuin-A, a significant hepatokine [ [54] , [55] , [56] ]. Karampela et al. sought to investigate the early association between bilirubin to fetuin-A (B/F) ratio in sepsis and its impact on severity and prognosis among critically ill patients [ 56 ]. The baseline and one-week B/F ratios exhibited a notably higher level in individuals experiencing septic shock and those who did not survive, in contrast to those with sepsis and survivors. Additionally, the B/F ratio displayed a positive correlation with severity scores and demonstrated superior predictive capability for mortality compared to bilirubin in ROC curve analysis. These findings suggest that the B/F ratio may hold promise as a potential sepsis biomarker with predictive utility in critically ill patients [ 56 ]. Obesity and insulin resistance are increasingly prevalent among individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) [ [57] , [58] , [59] ]. Genetic and epigenetic factors, along with subcutaneous insulin administration, are implicated in the development of this concurrent condition [ 59 ]. Growing evidence suggests that the co-occurrence of obesity and IR independently predicts worse cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In an integrative literature review, Sikorskaya et al. aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of metformin as an add-on therapy to insulin in poorly controlled adolescents with T1DM and overweight [ 60 ]. The results indicated that combining metformin with insulin therapy improved metabolic control in patients. However, the quality of metabolic control varied across studies due to differences in study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and methodologies. Adjunctive metformin therapy demonstrates a favorable impact on diabetes management, as well as in the prevention of cardiovascular complications with a minimal risk of adverse effects. The review also provides recommendations for further investigation of the research findings and their clinical implications [ 60 ]. In recent decades, there has been a notable rise in the prevalence and incidence of gout, with rates reaching 11\u201313% and 0.4% respectively among individuals aged over 80. Age-related decline in kidney function, changes in drug distribution, and a higher occurrence of other health conditions, including obesity, have notable implications for the safe and efficient pharmacological management of gout [ 61 , 62 ]. In a literature review, Patil et al. provide a concise summary of in vivo experimental models of gouty arthritis, focusing on evaluating the hypouricemic, anti-inflammatory, and renal protective effects of test compounds. They delve into specific evaluation parameters to offer a detailed perspective [ 61 ]. The escalating challenge of obesity underscores the necessity for a deeper comprehension of its pathophysiology, particularly concerning adipose tissue [ [63] , [64] , [65] , [66] , [67] , [68] , [69] , [70] ]. Animal models of obesity play a pivotal role in exploring potential mechanisms and implications associated with this condition. The utilization of animal models in obesity research is important for exploring potential mechanisms and implications of the condition. However, it is essential to acknowledge and consider various factors, including anatomical and pathophysiological differences among species, when interpreting preclinical results [ 71 ]. Examples of conflicting results among preclinical models and human physiological studies include the natural history of obesity development, the presence of hypoxia in the adipose tissue of obese animals, the adipose tissue browning, endocrine function and fibrosis. Lempesis et al. summarized the similarities and differences between rodent models and humans, factors that should be duly considered in research studies focused on obesity [ 71 ]. Finally, this Special Issue features four research highlights on recent significant studies in metabolism [ [72] , [73] , [74] , [75] ]. These highlights comment on recent studies on the mitochondrial quality control for promoting longevity [ 76 ], the action of manganese ions as a messenger to regulate serum lipid levels [ 77 ], the temporal and spatial dynamics of the immune response following myocardial infarction [ 78 ], and the role of apoptotic cells in supporting immune homeostasis by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation [ 79 ]. In conclusion, we hope this Special Issue, featuring manuscripts from our esteemed colleagues, may advance the understanding of recent research in clinical metabolomics and metabolism.
