    "Biomarker Discovery and Diagnostics This area of research plays a pivotal role in identifying and characterizing biomarkers \u2014 indicators that provide crucial insights into an organism\u2019s physiological state. The discovery of biomarkers through metabolomics offers a diagnostic window into various conditions for human health and disease research. By analyzing unique metabolic signatures associated with diseases like cancer , diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, researchers can unveil specific biomarkers that serve as early indicators. This information facilitates early diagnosis and opens avenues for monitoring disease progression and assessing treatment responses quickly."
